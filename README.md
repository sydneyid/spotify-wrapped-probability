# spotify-wrapped-probability


**Feature 1**
Code to look at how my most played songs change over the course of a year. Pretty basic figure looking at the distribution over a year, with a table to the right that shows the exact number of plays total.

From here, the plan is to use more advanced packages to make a more pretty animated graph + also overlay data analysis about how my most listened to songs changed month to month against my overall lsitening mood. (trying to determine if theres a correlation between life events and class of music)


**Features to Add in Future**

1. Year to year comparisons of each month and the type of music I listened to
2. Teacher Mode -- spotify statistics when you remove all children's genre music
3. Ultrarunner mode -- spotify statistics when you remove the music i listen to during my long runs/overlapping time i had a Strava Activity
